# Define a class Person with:
#
#  - An attribute first_name
#  - An attribute last_name
#  - An attribute birthdate (we can assign a string here, e.g. "April 19, 1987")
#  - An instance method, full_name, that puts first_name and last_name together
#  - An instance method, age, that calculates the number of years between today and birthdate
#
# These methods should **return** a value; they shouldn't print anything to the terminal.
#
# You can test your instance methods by adding to the end of this file:
#
#   new_person = Person.new
#   new_person.first_name = "Joe"
#   new_person.last_name = "Mama"
#   p new_person.full_name 
# Output:
#   "Joe Mama"
#
#   other_person = Person.new
#   other_person.birthdate = "April 19, 1987"
#   p other_person.age
# Output:
#   45

class Person
